        Grab a ball of fresh mozzarella, a handful of basil, and the best tomatoes you can find, 
        and make this Caprese salad recipe before summer slips away!

        A great Caprese salad starts with great ingredients. This recipe is meant for summertime, 
        when tomatoes are at their juiciest, sweetest, and most flavorful. 
        I like stop by the farmers market and collect as many colorful heirloom tomatoes 
        as I can. Not only are they beautiful, but each type tastes a little bit different, 
        and it’s fun to showcase them in this simple salad. Look for greens, yellows, and reds, 
        and try to find a variety of shapes – cherry tomatoes are fair game here too!
